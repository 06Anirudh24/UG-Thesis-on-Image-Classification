# Undergraduate Thesis on Image Classification Techniques
This work is a part of my UG thesis where we performed multiple experiments on various state-of-the-art image classifiers. The work is divided into two parts: -
1) Training the models to distinguish between face and face-like objects and to recognise face-like objects when hidden amidst other objects. This work has been accepted for publication at the DICTA 2022 Conference. 
2) Performing personality tests and psychological images tests on CNNs to understand if they possess any biases and if they mimic any particular human personality trait. This work has been accepted for publication at the ACIS 2022 Conference. 

Ongoing Research: - 
1) Study of camouflage detection techniques using deep learning. 
2) Application of computer vision in radiomics and cancer detection.
